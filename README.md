    Got most of the functionality for this done yesterday. Just styling to do now. For some reason I feel pretty grey at the moment. Just not vibing fully fr fr. Feel like I've got a cute simple idea for this though. Disregarding the fact that the actual sent messages don't seem to stick around on the site for too long, each message becomes a brick of a house this little guy Jerry is building. That's basically it.
